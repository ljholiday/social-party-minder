# Description
**Party Minder** is a social event coordination platform designed to make real-world gatherings effortless, inclusive, and actually social. It helps hosts plan events like dinner parties by simplifying guest invites, tracking preferences (like dietary restrictions and availability), coordinating menus, and enabling communication before and after the event.

At its core, Party Minder is also an AI-assisted platform. AI features help with tasks like:

* Suggesting menus based on guest preferences and allergies
* Generating event summaries and reminders
* Recommending nearby vendors (grocers, food trucks, caterers)
* Enhancing group chat with smart prompts and planning support

Built using a modular, Unix-style architecture with text-based APIs, Party Minder supports both free and premium add-ons and is designed to integrate with decentralized social protocols like AT Protocol. It’s not just event planning—it’s social networking for real life.
